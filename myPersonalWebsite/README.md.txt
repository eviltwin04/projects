Description
My project is a personal website to be used as a template 
to showcase my skills, resume and coding knowledge

Custom CSS Classes
The class(es) I created are:

I added a lot of these but will list five here. 

1. .mainNav - Sticky header, adds padding, allows for main nav to turn into hamburger menu with screen re-size, changes background color,
adds margins, padding, transparent background, directs users to specific sections when links are clicked

2. .paragraph-section - floats text left around image, allows for uniform format between sections, adds text color, position and font size

3.  .title - sets position, size, color, spacing of main greeting text

4. .mainImage - sets main greeting image, size, shape, margin, border radius

5.  .main-footer - creates sticky footer, sets text to center, allows interactive links/ pop-up email text box on click

2.

1. $(document).ready(function() - allows for my min nav to display as a hamburger drop-down when clicked

2. function button1() - confirms form submission when form button is clicked

3. $('#emailButton').on('click', emailMe); - allows for form information to be transfered to an email template

4. document.getElementsByTagName - changes h2 text from upper to lower case when moused over

5. const $odd = $('a:odd'); - Very, very much borrowed from tree house (I really just liked this behavior), but requires the pdf checkbox to be checked or else 
throws up a pop up notifying the user that it needs to be checked.
